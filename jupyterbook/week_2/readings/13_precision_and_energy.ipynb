    "Llama is a powerful AI model developed by Meta that can generate human-like text for various applications. It can have 405 billion parameters training Llama requires immense computational power, leading to high energy costs and a significant carbon footprint, often comparable to powering hundreds of homes for days. To address this, Meta uses techniques like quantization, which simplifies the model's calculations. This reduces energy consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact while ensuring the model remains accurate. Quantization also allows Llama to run efficiently on smaller devices like smartphones, making it more sustainable and cost-effective.\n",
