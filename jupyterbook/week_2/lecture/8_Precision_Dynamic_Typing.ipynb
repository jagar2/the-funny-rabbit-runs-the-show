    "**Why does precision matter?**  \n",
    "The limitations of floating-point precision have led to real-world catastrophes. One famous example is the **Patriot Missile failure** during the Gulf War in 1991. A calculation error caused by floating-point precision led to the missile defense system's failure to intercept an incoming missile, resulting in the loss of lives. Understanding these concepts is critical in engineering and science to avoid similar disasters.\n",
