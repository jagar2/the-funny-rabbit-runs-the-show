    "# ❓ 🩺 Chevalier Jackson Collection Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chevalier Jackson Collection contains thousands of objects extracted from patients' airways and esophagi. These include items such as safety pins, coins, buttons, needles, toy parts, dentures, animal bones, keys, and poker chips.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define an Object Dictionary**:\n",
    "   - Create a dictionary called `object_info` to represent a single item in the collection.\n",
    "   - The dictionary should include the following keys:\n",
    "     - `catalog_number`: A string, e.g., \"CJC-001\".\n",
    "     - `description`: A string, e.g., \"Open safety pin\".\n",
    "     - `type`: A string, e.g., \"Foreign Body\".\n",
    "     - `year_removed`: An integer, e.g., 1923.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   object_info = {\n",
    "       \"catalog_number\": \"CJC-010\",\n",
    "       \"description\": \"poker chip\",\n",
    "       \"type\": \"Foreign Body\",\n",
    "       \"year_removed\": 2002\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access and Print Information**:\n",
    "   - Use dictionary key access to print the following sentence using the data in `object_info`:\n",
    "     - \"The item CJC-010 is an poker chip classified as a Foreign Body, removed in 2002.\"\n",
    "     - The statement should be saved to the variable `print_statement`, we have provided the code to print the statement for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modify the Dictionary**:\n",
    "   - Update the `year_removed` to `1925`.\n",
    "   - Print the updated dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add a New Key**:\n",
    "   - Add a new key called `condition` with the value \"Good\" to the dictionary.\n",
    "   - Print the updated dictionary."
