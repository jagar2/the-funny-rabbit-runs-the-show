    "In Magic: The Gathering, creatures and spells often have synergistic effects. For example, creating a Fibonacci sequence of tokens represents a creative challenge for deck builders who utilize mechanics like **\"Doubling Season\"** or **\"Parallel Lives\"**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement  \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function that generates a sequence of creature token powers based on a Fibonacci-like growth pattern. For example, **\"Kalonian Hydra\"** doubles its counters, and cards like **\"Aether Vial\"** enable incremental growth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function to simulate the Fibonacci sequence for such token growth mechanics. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Fibonacci sequence is a list of integers in which the $n\\text{th}$ entry $x_n$ is computed from:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_n = x_{n-1} + x_{n-2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To initiate a Fibbonaci sequence, one must provide values for $x_0$ and $x_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $x_0 = 0$ and $x_1 = 1$, the first 10 terms of the sequence are:\n",

    "\n",

    "### Instructions  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a function called `fibonacci_tokens` that accepts 3 inputs:  \n",
    "    - `x0`: Initial power of the first token.  \n",
    "    - `x1`: Initial power of the second token.  \n",
    "    - `L`: The total number of tokens to generate in the sequence.  \n",
    "2. Implement the function to return a list of the first `L` Fibonacci-like token powers starting with `x0` and `x1`.\n",
    "    - Define a list `seq` to store the first two initial values `x0` and `x1`, of the sequence.\n",
    "    - Use a `for` loop to generate the remaining `L-2` values of the sequence. I would recommend using the `range` function to iterate over the remaining values.\n",
    "    - Append the new values to the list `seq` at each iteration, by indexing the last 2 elements of the list. Use the built-in `append` method of the list object. ***hint***: This is a perfect opportunity to revisit the negative indexing of lists.\n",
    "3. If the input `L` is less than 2, print \"Fibonacci-like growth not possible\".  Use if statements to enforce that the fibonacci sequence is not generated. \n"

    "## 🧙‍♂️ Question 3: Find the Best Card to Play  \n",
    "\n",
    "![Magic: The Gathering](./assets/figures/serra-angel.jpg)  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Magic The Gathering, choosing the right card to play at the right time can be the difference between victory and defeat. Suppose you’re building a deck that revolves around cards with varying mana costs, power, toughness, and special abilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to determine the **best card to play** given the available mana and the current game state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement  \n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a function that evaluates a list of cards and finds the **best card to play** based on the following criteria:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The card's **mana cost** must not exceed the available mana in any color or the total mana.  \n",
    "2. The card with the **highest combined power and toughness** is preferred if multiple cards can be played.  \n",
    "3. In case of a tie in power and toughness, a card with a special ability (e.g., \"Trample\") should be prioritized.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have defined a function `find_best_card_to_play` that accepts the following inputs:  \n",
    "   - **`available_mana`**: A dictionary specifying the available mana in each color.  \n",
    "     Example:  \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     available_mana = {\"green\": 3, \"red\": 2, \"colorless\": 1}\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **`cards`**: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a card with the following attributes:  \n",
    "     - `\"name\"`: Name of the card.  \n",
    "     - `\"mana_cost\"`: A dictionary specifying the card's mana cost in each color.  \n",
    "     - `\"power\"`: The card's power.  \n",
    "     - `\"toughness\"`: The card's toughness.  \n",
    "     - `\"abilities\"`: A list of special abilities (e.g., `[\"Trample\", \"Flying\"]`).  \n",
    "     Example:  \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     cards = [\n",
    "         {\"name\": \"Elf Warrior\", \"mana_cost\": {\"green\": 2, \"red\": 0, \"colorless\": 0}, \"power\": 2, \"toughness\": 3, \"abilities\": []},\n",
    "         {\"name\": \"Goblin Berserker\", \"mana_cost\": {\"green\": 0, \"red\": 2, \"colorless\": 1}, \"power\": 3, \"toughness\": 2, \"abilities\": [\"Trample\"]},\n",
    "         {\"name\": \"Orc Chieftain\", \"mana_cost\": {\"green\": 1, \"red\": 1, \"colorless\": 1}, \"power\": 5, \"toughness\": 3, \"abilities\": []}\n",
    "     ]\n",
    "     ```  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Evaluate all cards and find the one that:  \n",
    "   - Can be played with the available mana.  \n",
    "   - Has the highest combined power and toughness.  \n",
    "   - If tied, has at least one special ability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Return the name of the best card to play. You can do that by assigning the name of the best card to a variable `best_card`, we have provided the return statement for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. If no card can be played, assign `\"No card can be played\"` to a variable `best_card`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided some additional inline comments to help you solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "available_mana = {\"green\": 3, \"red\": 2, \"colorless\": 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "cards = [\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Elf Warrior\", \"mana_cost\": {\"green\": 2, \"red\": 0, \"colorless\": 0}, \"power\": 2, \"toughness\": 3, \"abilities\": []},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Goblin Berserker\", \"mana_cost\": {\"green\": 0, \"red\": 2, \"colorless\": 1}, \"power\": 3, \"toughness\": 2, \"abilities\": [\"Trample\"]},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Orc Chieftain\", \"mana_cost\": {\"green\": 1, \"red\": 1, \"colorless\": 1}, \"power\": 5, \"toughness\": 3, \"abilities\": []}\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the best card to play is **\"Goblin Berserker\"**, the function returns:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"Goblin Berserker\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
