    "On TikTok, reels keep playing one after another, looping endlessly unless you take action—like swiping to the next video, closing the app, or running out of content. Similarly, **while loops** in Python repeat a block of code **until a condition is no longer true**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Just like TikTok reels, **while loops** repeat endlessly until you break the flow. Whether you’re interacting with user input, skipping boring items, or timing out the session, `while` loops offer dynamic control for repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`while condition:`**: The loop runs as long as the condition is true.\n",
    "2. **Infinite Loops**: Great for continuous processes (but be cautious!).\n",
    "3. **`break`**: Exit the loop early when a specific condition is met.\n",
    "4. **`continue`**: Skip over the current iteration and move to the next.\n",
    "5. **Counters and Conditions**: Use counters to limit or manage iterations.\n",
    "6. **Nested Loops**: Perfect for organizing complex structures like categories or playlists.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this knowledge, you can handle loops like a pro—whether you're programming TikTok reels or any other repetitive process! 🎥✨\n",
