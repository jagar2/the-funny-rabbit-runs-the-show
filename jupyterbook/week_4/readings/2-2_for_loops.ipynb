    "3. **Nested Loops**: Handle complex scenarios, like multiple boards or levels.\n",
    "4. **Break and Continue**: Stop or skip parts of the loop when needed, like avoiding ghosts or saving power pellets.\n",
    "5. **Strings and More**: Loop through any sequence, from lists to strings and beyond.\n",
