First time realizing boys don’t look like Zac Efron. \n",

    "But the problem? Neither of us had ever kissed anyone. And we weren’t exactly *thriving* in the social scene. I was in marching band, and Tara was in something called the Book Bowl Club (which, for the record, is not as cool as it sounds). So, we made a deal. By the end of the school year, we would each experience The Kiss™.\n",

    "For Tara, things unfolded pretty smoothly. She “fell in love” with a kid named Brad who wore Axe body spray like a force field. By Valentine’s Day, they were sharing awkward hand-holds and secret smiles during study hall. I heard from a reliable source (Tara herself) that Brad kissed her behind the bleachers after a basketball game. She was officially on the scoreboard.\n",
    "\n",

One Friday, as we were walking home from school, Jason casually asked if I wanted to hang out at the park.\n",
    "\n",
    "My heart exploded. I had never been “asked out,” not even indirectly. Tara was thrilled for me. She braided my hair, lent me her sparkly lip gloss, and whispered, “Tonight’s the night.” And somehow, I believed her.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the park, we swung on the swings and talked about important ninth-grade things: movies, homework, and whether we thought aliens existed. Then, as the sun started to set, Jason turned to me and said, “You’re really cool, you know that?”\n",
    "\n",
    "I froze. Was this it? Was this the moment?\n",

    "Jason leaned closer. My brain went into full panic mode. What if I did it wrong? What if my lips were *weird*? And most horrifying of all: what if I missed?
