So, we will have 4 total things to display: water, ships, hits, and missing. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to visually parse, `Board`, the object we use to pass data between functions, will be displayed using a unicode character (`â– ` in different colors for ships, hits, and misses). However, inside each of the functions `board` will be defined using the single string characters, `\"~\"`, `\"S\"`, `\"X\"`, and `\"M\"`. This is becuase python cannot perform operations using unicode characters as objects. However, it can display unicode characters â€” even with formatting options like color â€” to the console, which is how we will display the board as the last step once operations related to ship placement or targeting are performed. \n",

    "The outer loop iterates through each `row` of `board`, making a new blank list, which we will call `color_dat`. It has exactly  enough entries to store data describing the desired form and color of each individual `element` in that `row`. The inner loop performs a logical test on each `element` in the `row` of `board`, and appends a string of formatting characters to `color_dat` depending on what was found at that `element`. This process continues running until every entry in the matrix has been checked and `color_dat` is a matrix of strings containing exactly the same number of elements as `board`, but in a form that looks much better when output the console. We don't need to worry about retaining this data to perform operations on, so we just print directly to the console (`display_board` has no return line).\n",
    "\n",
    "A major benefit of using a new blank list populated with formatting data for the printed output is that `board` still exists as an object retaining all of its original data (along with any updates from `place_ship()` or `fire_shot()`). Since `board` is easy to update and maintain, that let's us continually add new data to it without having to reinitialize every time. \n",
