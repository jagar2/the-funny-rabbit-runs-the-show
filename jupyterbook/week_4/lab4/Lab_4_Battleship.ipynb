    "\n",
    "Now that we have a game board filled with `~` to represent water, we want to replace some of those `~` with `\"S\"` to represent ships placed by a player.\n",
    "\n",

    "To iterate through the list of ship coordinates (`coordinates`), you will assign each tuple's values to two variables, `row` and `col`. These variables will represent the row and column indices for each part of the ship's placement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- write the for loop around the coordinates, the  `for ... in coordinates` loop with `row, col` so that each tuple in `coordinates` is unpacked into `row` (for the row index) and `col` (for the column index).\n",

    "**Example:**  \n",
    "If `coordinates = [(1, 2), (2, 2)]`, on the first iteration:\n",
    "- `row` will be assigned `1`\n",
    "- `col` will be assigned `2`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Adjust Row and Column for Python's Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this game requires human input and we want the board to count rows and columns starting from `(1, 1)` (upper leftmost element), we need to adjust the indices from the 1-based input to Python's 0-based indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a compound assignment operator (`-=`) to subtract `1` from `row` and update its value. Replace the `...` in `row -= ...` with `1`.\n",
    "- Similarly, do the same for `col` by replacing `...` in `col -= ...` with `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**  \n",
    "This adjustment ensures that when you use `board[row][col]`, it correctly points to the intended element on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Place the Ship on the Board\n",
    "Now that the `row` and `col` variables have been adjusted for Python's indexing:\n",
    "- Use `board[row][col] = \"S\"` to mark the corresponding cell in the `board` with `\"S\"`.\n",
    "\n",

    "Now that we have functions to generate and manage the game board, we want to display the board in the console. The board will eventually show four types of data: water, ships, hits, and misses.\n",
    "\n",

    "- For display purposes, these will be converted into visually formatted Unicode characters (`â– `) in different colors. This is done because Python cannot easily operate on Unicode characters but can display them in the console.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Uses **two nested loops** to iterate through each element of the board.\n",
    "2. Performs **four logical tests** to check the type of each board element.\n",
    "3. Appends formatted strings to a temporary list (`color_dat`) for display.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define `color_dat`:**\n",
    "   - Inside the outer loop `for row in board:`, initialize a blank list called `color_dat` to store formatted data for the row.\n",
    "   - Replace the `...` with `color_dat = []`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perform Logical Tests:**\n",
    "   - Inside the inner loop `for element in row:`, add string characters to each logical test based on the board's data.\n",
    "   - Use the following mappings:\n",
    "     - `\"~\"`: Water\n",
    "     - `\"S\"`: Ship\n",
    "     - `\"X\"`: Hit\n",
    "     - `\"M\"`: Miss\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add Formatting Characters:**\n",
    "   - Use the escape sequences below in the respective `color_dat.append(...)` calls nested in the `if` and `elif` logical tests:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     color_dat.append(\"\\033[96m~\\033[0m\")  # Blue for water\n",
    "     color_dat.append(\"\\033[30mâ– \\033[0m\")  # Black for ships\n",
    "     color_dat.append(\"\\033[31mâ– \\033[0m\")  # Red for hits\n",
    "     color_dat.append(\"\\033[37mâ– \\033[0m\")  # Grey/White for misses\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Print the Board:**\n",
    "   - Once the `color_dat` list is complete for a row, print it to display the formatted board. The function should return color_dat."

    "   \n",
    "2. **Adjust for Human-Friendly Input:**\n",
    "   - Since `target` uses 1-based indexing (human-readable), but Python uses 0-based indexing, decrement `row` and `col` by 1. Replace the `...` in the next two lines with the appropriate adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Determine the Action Based on the Board State:**\n",
    "   - Analyze the current value of `board[row][col]`:\n",
    "     - If it is `\"X\"`, this means the space has already been fired at. Replace the `...` with a return statement: `\"Already Fired\"`.\n",
    "     - If it contains `\"S\"`, it represents a ship. Update the space to `\"X\"` (to mark a hit) and return `\"Hit\"`.\n",
    "     - If it contains `\"~\"`, it represents water. Update the space to `\"M\"` (to mark a miss) and return `\"Miss\"`.\n",
    "     - For any other value, it is an invalid input. Replace the `...` with a return statement: `\"Invalid Target\"`.\n",
    "\n",
