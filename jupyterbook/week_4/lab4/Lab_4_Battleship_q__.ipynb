So, we will have 4 total things to display: water, ships, hits, and missing. \n",

    "To make it easier to visually parse, `Board`, the object we use to pass data between functions, will be displayed using a unicode character (`â– ` in different colors for ships, hits, and misses).

The inner loop performs a logical test on each `element` in the `row` of `board`, and appends a string of formatting characters to `color_dat` depending on what was found at that `element`. This process continues running until every entry in the matrix has been checked and `color_dat` is a matrix of strings containing exactly the same number of elements as `board`, but in a form that looks much better when output the console. We don't need to worry about retaining this data to perform operations on, so we just print directly to the console (`display_board` has no return line).\n",
