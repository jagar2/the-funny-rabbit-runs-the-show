    "\n",
    "Our mission, should we choose to accept it (and we totally do), is to unravel the mysteries hidden within this dataset. We'll start by conjuring up a dazzling data profile using ydata_profiling. Think of it as a crystal ball that reveals the secrets of our data—distributions, correlations, and maybe even a few skeletons in the closet. 🧙‍♂️🔮\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, there's more! We're not just stopping at data profiling. Oh no, we're going full Picasso with Bokeh, crafting an interactive scatter plot masterpiece. Picture this: housing prices dancing with population numbers, all under the spotlight of your mouse cursor. Tooltips will be our backstage pass, giving us the inside scoop on each data point. 🎨🖱️\n",
    "\n",
    "And for those of you with a penchant for precision, we've got a filtering function that lets you sift through listings like a pro. Want to see only the homes with at least four bedrooms? No problem! Our ZillowAnalyzer class is here to make your real estate dreams come true.\n",
    "So buckle up, grab your virtual hard hat, and let's build some data-driven insights that would make even the most seasoned realtor green with envy. Let's get analyzing! 🏠💡📊\n",
