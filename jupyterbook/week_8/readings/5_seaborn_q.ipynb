    "\n",
    "Diamonds are often considered a symbol of luxury, and their prices are influenced by multiple factors such as cut, clarity, carat, and color. But how do these factors correlate with each other, and what insights can we gain from visualizing their relationships?  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we will explore the relationship between diamond cut quality and price using a **violin plot**, which helps us understand the distribution of diamond prices across different cut grades. Additionally, we will generate a **correlation heatmap** to identify which numerical features of diamonds (such as carat weight, depth, and table size) are most strongly related to price.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing these visualizations, we can answer key questions such as:  \n",
    "- Does a higher-quality cut always result in a higher price?  \n",
    "- Which diamond characteristics have the strongest correlation with price?  \n",
    "- Are there any surprising patterns or trends in the data?  \n",
    "\n",
