    "Monte Carlo simulations are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. They are often used to model phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs, such as the calculation of risk in business or the simulation of physical and mathematical systems. The basic idea is to use random numbers to simulate the behavior of a complex system, and then use the results to make predictions about the system's behavior.\n"
