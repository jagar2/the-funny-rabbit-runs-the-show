    "## Question: Beam Load Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In architectural engineering, calculating the load a beam can support is crucial for ensuring the safety and integrity of a structure. The total load on a beam includes both the dead load (permanent or static load, e.g., the weight of the beam itself and permanent fixtures) and live load (temporary or dynamic load, e.g., weight of people, furniture, snow).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a `Beam` class to model a structural beam in a building.\n",
    "2. Include methods within this class to calculate the dead load, live load, and total load the beam can support.\n",
    "3. Demonstrate the use of class initialization, basic math calculations, and functions calling other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class to Implement\n",
    "\n",
    "implement a class `Beam` with the following properties and methods:\n",
    "   - Methods:\n",
    "     - `__init__`: Initializes a new `Beam` instance with the properties.\n",
    "         - Properties:\n",
    "           - `length` (in meters)\n",
    "           - `width` (in meters)\n",
    "           - `depth` (in meters)\n",
    "           - `material_density` (in kg/m³, representing the density of the beam material)\n",
    "           - `live_load_per_m2` (in kg, representing the expected maximum live load per square meter)\n",
    "     - `volume`: Calculates and returns the volume of the beam.\n",
    "       - The volume of a rectangular prism (beam) is calculated as length x width x depth.\n",
    "     - `dead_load`: Calculates and returns the dead load of the beam based on its volume and material density.\n",
    "       - The dead load is the volume of the beam multiplied by its material density.\n",
    "     - `live_load`: Calculates and returns the total live load the beam can support, based on the beam's length and the specified live load per square meter.\n",
    "       - Live load is the beam's surface area (length x width) multiplied by the live load per square meter.\n",
    "     - `total_load`: Calculates and returns the total load the beam can support by summing its dead and live loads.\n",
    "       - the total load is the sum of the dead and live loads.\n",
    "     - `print_loads`: Prints the dead, live, and total loads of the beam in the following format:\n",
    "       - \"Dead Load: {dead_load} kg\\nLive Load: {live_load} kg\\nTotal Load: {total_load} kg\" where the values are extracted from the object rounded to 2 decimal places.\n",
    "       - Note: you must use a **single print command**, \\n is used to create a new line in the print statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantiate a `Beam` object to the variable `beam` the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Beam dimensions: 8m (length) x 0.5m (width) x 0.25m (depth)\n",
    "   - Material density: 2400 kg/m³ (concrete)\n",
    "   - Live load per square meter: 500 kg/m²\n"

This can cause there to be local variables needed for your solution that would not be recreated on running your code again from scratch. Your assignment will be graded based on running your code from scratch. This means before you submit your assignment you should restart the kernel and run all cells. You can do this by clicking `Kernel` and selecting `Restart and Run All`. If you code does not run as expected after restarting the kernel and running all cells it means you have an error in your code. \n",
