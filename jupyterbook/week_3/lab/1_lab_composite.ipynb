    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Composite materials are advanced materials engineered by combining two or more distinct constituent materials, each with significantly different physical or chemical properties. The resulting composite exhibits unique characteristics that differ from those of its individual components, while the constituents remain separate and distinct within the final structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this lab is to leverage **NumPy** to develop a robust system for calculating the properties of a composite material based on the properties of its individual components, their volume fractions, and the orientation of fibers. This capability is crucial for designing high-performance materials and structures. For example, carbon fiber composites are widely used in aerospace applications due to their exceptional strength-to-weight ratio. Accurate prediction of the properties of these materials is vital to ensure they meet application-specific requirements and to design materials with tailored properties along different axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals: \n",
    "\n",
    "You want to compute the **effective stiffness** of a 2D composite (plane stress) reinforced by short fibers (or platelets) whose orientations are **not uniform**—instead, they follow some **anisotropic orientation distribution**. Each filler phase has **local** stiffness $\\mathbf{Q}_\\text{local}$ in its principal axes, and you also know the **matrix** stiffness. Your goal is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define** the 2D plane-stress stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{Q}_\\text{local}$ for the **filler** in its local coordinate system (aligned with principal directions).\n",
    "2. **Rotate** that local stiffness into the **global** coordinates for each orientation $\\theta$ the filler may have, using a transformation matrix $\\mathbf{T}(\\theta)$.\n",
    "3. **Combine** these rotated filler stiffness matrices, weighted by their **orientation distribution** (i.e., the fraction of fibers oriented at each $\\theta$), and then add the **matrix** contribution to get the overall **effective** stiffness of the composite.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your tasks are to **Write a Python/NumPy script** that:\n",
    "   - Builds a **local filler** stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{Q}_\\text{local}$.\n",
    "   - Implements **rotation** of $\\mathbf{Q}_\\text{local}$ to $\\mathbf{\\bar{Q}}(\\theta)$ for a given $\\theta$.\n",
    "   - Summation or integration of $\\mathbf{\\bar{Q}}(\\theta)$ across the **anisotropic distribution** to get $\\mathbf{Q}_\\text{filler,eff}$.\n",
    "   - Combines the filler result with **matrix** stiffness to obtain the final $\\mathbf{Q}_\\text{eff}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't Worry** you are not expected to know the math required to solve this problem, we will guide you through the process, and explain the math behind the solution as we go along."
