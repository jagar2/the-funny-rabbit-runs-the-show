    "You’re helping an angry bird hit its target with a slingshot! The slingshot uses a **spring with spring constant $k$** (in $\\mathrm{N/m}$) and launches a bird of mass $x$ (in $\\mathrm{kg}$). The target is **1 km away** horizontally and **10 m high** vertically.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the distance to pull the spring ($d$):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assume the spring is linear and obeys Hooke's Law: $F = k d$, where $F$ is the force applied.\n",
    "2. The slingshot launches the bird with **no air resistance** and at an optimal launch angle $\\theta$ for the given conditions.\n",
    "3. The acceleration due to gravity is $g = 9.8 \\, \\mathrm{m/s^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following physics principles:\n",
    "- Horizontal motion: $x_{\\text{target}} = v_x t$\n",
    "- Vertical motion: $y_{\\text{target}} = v_y t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2$\n",
    "- Initial velocities: \n",
    "  - $v_x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta)$\n",
    "  - $v_y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta)$\n",
    "- The total velocity $v_0$ is related to the spring compression distance $d$ by energy conservation:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\frac{1}{2} k d^2 = \\frac{1}{2} x v_0^2\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Find $d$, the distance the spring must be pulled back, symbolically.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Python Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import SymPy using the alias `sp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define the variables as SymPy symbols: `m`, `k`, `d`, `theta`, `g`, `v_0`, `t`, `xtarget`, and `ytarget`. Use the `sp.symbols()` function to define multiple symbols at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Define the values for gravity `g_value`, xtarget `xtarget_value`, ytarget `ytarget_value`, bird mass `m_value`, spring constant `k_value`, and angle `theta_value`. Ensure that all values are in SI units, and the angle `theta_value` is in radians. Make sure to use the `sp.pi` constant for $\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Define the equation for conservation of energy: $\\frac{1}{2} k d^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v_0^2$. Use the `sp.Eq()` function to define the equation and save it in a variable called `energy_eq`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Solve the equation for $v_0$ using the `sp.solve()` function. Save the result in a variable called `v0_expr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Note:** The solution will return a list of potential solutions. Extract the positive solution, which is the valid initial velocity, by indexing the first element of the list. Recall that the 1st element of a list in Python has an index of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Define the equations for horizontal and vertical motion using the expressions for velocity. Use `sp.cos()` and `sp.sin()` functions for the trigonometric functions, and the variable for velocity `v0_expr`. Save the horizontal and vertical motion equations in variables called `vx_eq` and `vy_eq`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You do not need to use the sp.Eq() function for these equations, as you already have the expressions in terms of the one unknown variable `vx_eq` and `vy_eq`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Define the equations for the instantaneous position of the bird in the x and y directions as functions of time `t`. Use the provided equations for motion. Save the equations in variables called `xpos_eq` and `ypos_eq`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Set up the equation for the time when the bird reaches the target x-position `xpos_eq` to `xtarget`. Save the equation in a variable called `targetx_eq`. Use the `sp.Eq()` function to set up the equation, since we do not have an explicit expression for time `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Solve the equation `targetx_eq` for time `t` using the `sp.solve()` function. Save the result in a variable called `t_eq`. Select the valid solution for `t` (e.g., the positive value). This is index 0 in the list of solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Define the equation for the vertical position of the bird at time `t`. Substitute the expression `t_eq` into the vertical motion equation `ypos_eq`. Save the resulting expression in a variable called `y_eq`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: your answer should be exactly the same as the provided equation for vertical motion in part 7. You just need to replace `t` with the solution `t_eq`.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Set up the equation for the target y-position by equating `y_eq` to `ytarget` using the `sp.Eq()` function. Save the equation in a variable called `ytarget_eq`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Solve the equation `ytarget_eq` for the pull distance `d` using the `sp.solve()` function. Save the result in a variable called `d_expr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. The solution `d_expr` will return a list of potential solutions. Extract the positive solution, which is the valid pull distance, by indexing the second element of the list. Save it in a variable called `d_solution`.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Construct a dictionary called `subs_dict` containing the variable names as keys and their corresponding values as values. Use the values defined earlier for the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: SymPy symbols are valid keys for the dictionary. SymPy will expect that the key is a symbol, and it will substitute the value accordingly. Do not use the string representation of the variable names as the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Substitute the values into the `d_solution` expression using the `subs()` function, passing the dictionary `subs_dict` as an argument. Evaluate the result numerically using the `evalf()` function. Save the result in a variable called `final_result`. You should also print the final result for the pull distance `d`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "final_result = d_solution.subs(subs_dict).evalf()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
