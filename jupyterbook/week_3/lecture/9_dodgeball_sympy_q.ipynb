    "In the dodgeball arena, a player throws the ball with an initial velocity. Your task is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use SymPy to solve the height equation $h(t) = v_0t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2$ for the time when the ball hits the ground.\n",
    "2. Assume $v_0 = 15$ m/s and $g = 9.8$ m/s².\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solution must include:\n",
    "A function `solve_projectile_time()` that (we have provided this function for you):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the symbols `t`, `v0`, and `g`.\n",
    "2. Define the height equation `h` symbolically.\n",
    "3. Solve the height equation for time when height is zero. To do this, use the `solve()` function, which takes two arguments: the equation to solve and the variable to solve for, in this case `t`.\n",
    "4. Build the dictionaries with the values to substitute. We have provided the code for you to filter positive times - it would not make sense to have a negative time.\n",
    "5. Compute the time by substituting the values of `v0` and `g` into the equation. We did this using the `subs()` function, which takes a dictionary of symbols and values to substitute. We didn't want you to do this step because it requires a loop which you have not learned yet. \n"
