    "Non-linear systems of equations are like trying to solve a puzzle where the rules don’t follow straight lines. Instead of easy, predictable relationships (like $(x + y = 10)$), you get curvy, messy ones (like $(x^2 + y^2 = 25)$, a circle). These systems involve equations with squares, cubes, or other funky stuff that make them bend, twist, or loop. Solving them is like figuring out where all the curves and loops meet—it’s trickier than straight-line math, but it’s how we handle real-world chaos, like predicting weather or designing rocket trajectories! 🌪️🚀📐\n",

    "SymPy simplifies differential equations, critical for dynamic systems like vibrations, fluid flows, and control systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Differential equations are like math's way of describing how things change over time. Instead of just finding the answer, you’re solving for a **rule** about how something evolves—like how fast a car speeds up, how a virus spreads, or how coffee cools down. They involve derivatives (rates of change), so instead of saying $(y = 3x + 2)$, it’s more like, “How does $(y)$ change if it depends on $(x)$?” For example, if you’re pouring water into a tank, a differential equation tells you how the water level rises as time passes.

    "### Roots with Multiplicity\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Roots with multiplicity are like special \"sticky\" roots that affect how systems behave, which is super important in engineering. For example, in $( (x - 2)^2 = 0 )$, the root $(x = 2)$ has **multiplicity 2**, meaning the graph just touches the x-axis at that point but doesn’t cross it. Why does this matter? In engineering, systems modeled by equations often depend on these roots. If a root has higher multiplicity, it changes the system’s stability or response. For instance, in vibrations or control systems, repeated roots can mean slower damping or lingering oscillations. Essentially, roots with multiplicity are like hidden clues that tell engineers how their designs will behave under stress or dynamic conditions! 🏗️📊⚙️\n",

    "### Lambert W for Transcendental\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The Lambert W function is like a magical math tool for solving tricky equations where the variable is **stuck in both the base and the exponent**—a classic problem with transcendental equations. For example, if you have something like $( x e^x = 5 )$, there’s no way to solve it using regular algebra. This is where the Lambert W function comes in! It \"unsticks\" the variable by essentially reversing $( y = x e^x )$, giving $( x = W(y))$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why does this matter for engineering? Many real-world problems involve transcendental equations—like modeling diode currents in electronics, finding growth rates in population models, or solving time constants in heat transfer. The Lambert W function simplifies these problems into something solvable, making it an indispensable tool in areas like circuit design, control systems, and thermodynamics. It’s like a Swiss army knife for dealing with equations that don’t play by algebra's rules! 🔧📈✨\n",
