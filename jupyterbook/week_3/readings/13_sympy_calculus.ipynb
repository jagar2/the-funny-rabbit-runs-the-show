In math, it's like measuring the steepness (slope) of a hill on a graph: flat ground means zero change, while a steep hill means big change. For example, if your function is $(y = x^2)$, the derivative is $(2x)$, which tells you how fast $(y)$ (your height) is growing as $(x)$ (your position) increases.
