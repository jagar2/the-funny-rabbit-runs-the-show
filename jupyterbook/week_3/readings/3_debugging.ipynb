    "Welcome to the engineer’s rite of passage: debugging. Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in your program. Think of it as detective work, where you chase down those pesky mistakes and make your code behave. It’s frustrating, rewarding, and, dare we say, kind of fun once you get the hang of it. But where did the term come from? Let’s start with a little history.\n"

    "The term \"bug\" in computing has an interesting origin story. Back in 1947, engineers working on the Harvard Mark II, an early computer, encountered a hardware problem. When they opened the machine, they found...a literal bug: a moth trapped in a relay! After removing the moth, they documented it in their logbook, humorously referring to the process as “debugging.”\n",
