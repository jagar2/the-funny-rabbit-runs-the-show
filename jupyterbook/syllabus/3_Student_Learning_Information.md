# ðŸ“– Student Learning Information

## Course Purpose within a Program of Study:

This course teaches students the skills necessary to take a computational problem in their engineering discipline, break it down into sub-problems, write an algorithm that solves a specific problem, and finally translate that algorithm into a clear and efficient program in a specific programming language. Therefore, the course addresses necessary skills for all engineering disciplines.

## Statement of Expected In-Person Engagement

This course consists of one 2-hour class session and one 2-hour lab session per week.

## Course Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

a. Develop algorithmic computational skills for problem-solving in a variety of engineering disciplines.

b. Design code, including syntax, modular design, conditionals, branching, data structures, and object-oriented programming.

c. Implement computer programs to solve engineering problems and visualize results.

## Drexel Student Learning Priorities

### Creative and Critical Thinking

Uses divergent (e.g., generation of novel ideas, thinking out of the box, brainstorming) and convergent thinking (e.g., critical thinking, evaluation of ideas, quantitative and qualitative analysis, scientific reasoning) to generate novel and relevant ideas, strategies, approaches or products.

### Technology Use

Make appropriate use of technologies to communicate, collaborate, solve problems, make decisions, and conduct research, as well as foster creativity and life-long learning.
