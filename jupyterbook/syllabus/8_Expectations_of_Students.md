# ðŸŽ“ Expectations of Students

We expect all students to dive headfirst into every aspect of the course. Each activity and assignment is crafted to boost your learning and set you up for success. So, roll up your sleeves, bring your A-game, and let's make this journey unforgettable!

## Pre-Class Session Readings

Before you step into the classroom, gear up by diving into the reading and learning activities on the JupyterBook. Think of it as your pre-game warm-up! This content is handpicked to get you cozy with the core concepts that we'll be leveling up in our class sessions. By tackling these assignments ahead of time, you'll be ready to hit the ground running, apply what you've learned, and spot any tricky misconceptions. So, grab your favorite snack, settle in, and get ready to conquer the pre-class prep like a pro!

## Class Sessions

Ready for some fun? Our 2-hour class sessions, held once a week, are where the magic happens! We'll dive deeper into the material from the JupyterBook, and you'll team up with your fellow adventurers to conquer new challenges. These sessions are packed with graded activities to test your skills and knowledge.

Attendance is crucialâ€”miss a class without a valid excuse, and you'll score a zero for that activity. But don't worry, we've got your back! We'll drop one assignment from the final grade to cover any unexpected life events. If you foresee missing more than one session, that's a big deal. Reach out to your academic advisor and instructor to explore your options. Let's make every class count!

## Homework

Every week, you'll embark on a solo adventure with an individual homework assignment. These quests are crafted to let you show off your independent mastery of the material from pre-class readings and class sessions. Think of these assignments as your personal battleground to wrestle with concepts and emerge victorious with a strong understanding.

While it's totally cool (and encouraged) to chat with your comrades (or even consult your trusty generative AI tools) about the homework, remember: your final submission should be your own masterpiece. You're the hero of your own story, so make sure you fully grasp the concepts and code.

It's perfectly fine to discuss code or peek at each other's work for inspiration, but beware! Sharing or copying chunks of code from one another or any other source is a big no-no. Keep it original, keep it honest, and keep it awesome!

## Labs

Ready to level up? Our lab sessions are your chance to tackle the big bosses of complex problems. Think of these as your training grounds where you can flex your problem-solving muscles and build that rock-solid confidence. Attendance isn't just recommendedâ€”it's your secret weapon to mastering the course. So, suit up, show up, and let's conquer these challenges together!

## Quizzes

Get ready to put your skills to the test! In the first half of each lab, you'll face a practical quiz designed to challenge your understanding of the course concepts. Make sure to bring your trusty, fully-charged laptop to every lab sessionâ€”it's your essential sidekick! If you're facing financial hardships and can't get your hands on a laptop, don't sweat it. Reach out to the instructor, and we'll try to hook you up with a loaner laptop. Remember, if you miss a quiz without an approved excuse, you'll score a zero for that quiz - we will drop one quiz score. So, gear up, stay sharp, and let's ace these quizzes together!

## Midterm and Final

Ready to show off your skills? Our midterm and final exams are your chance to shine and prove your individual mastery of the course concepts. These epic challenges will test your knowledge and your ability to connect the dots between everything you've learned.

The exams will be a mix of true-or-false queries, and practical coding tasks. Stay tuned for the exact date and timeâ€”TBD.

**TODO: Update with the confirmed date and time once finalized.**

So, sharpen those pencils, charge up your laptops, and get ready to conquer these exams like a true champion!
