    "# 🚀 Activity: Hello, World! JupyterHub  \n",
    "\n",
    "🎉 Welcome to your first adventure in JupyterHub! Let’s kick things off with a classic \"Hello, World!\" assignment—because why not keep traditions alive, right? Oh, and don't forget to share something fun about yourself and your neighbor (friendly vibes only!).  \n",

    "## Steps to Complete Your \"Hello, World!\" Assignment  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🖥️ Head over to the course website: [JupyterBook](https://courses.coe.drexel.edu/ENGR/ENGR131_W25).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. 🛸 In the upper right corner, find and click the **rocket icon** (it’s not there just for show—it launches JupyterHub 🚀).  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. 🔒 You’ll land on a login page. Select **Drexel University** and log in with your Drexel credentials. Easy peasy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. 🛠️ Next, pick an environment from the options. Choose **ENGR_131** because we’re sticking to the script here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. 📂 If all went well, the Jupyter Notebook file should automatically open. If it didn’t… well, try again (or maybe ask for help).  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. ✍️ In the first cell, type this masterpiece of code:  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"Hello, World! My name is <type your name>\")\n",
    "   ```  \n",
    "   🚨 Pro tip: Replace `<type your name>` with—wait for it—your actual name.  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. 🎯 Hit **Shift + Enter** to execute your code. Voilà! You should see your name in lights (or at least printed on the screen).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **And that’s it!** You’ve officially joined the ranks of coders who started their journey with \"Hello, World!\" Don't forget to share your fun fact—it’s your chance to be the most interesting person in the room!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, go forth and code like a star 🌟."
