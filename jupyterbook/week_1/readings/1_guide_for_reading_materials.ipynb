    "JupyterLab, and Jupyter notebooks are a common framework for coding used in industry and academia. They are used for data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, and more. JupyterLab is a powerful tool that allows for the creation of interactive notebooks that combine code, text, and visualizations.\n",

    "For this course we will be using JupyterLab. JupyterLab is an open-source tool that allows for the creation of interactive notebooks. JupyterLab is available as a web-based tool that can be run on your local machine or on a remote server. You can run JupyterLab on your local machine by installing the Anaconda distribution of Python. You can also run JupyterLab on a remote server by using a cloud-based service, such as Google Colab or Binder.\n",

The environment is pre-configured with all the necessary software and libraries for the course. You can access the environment by clicking on the [link](https://courses.coe.drexel.edu/ENGR/ENGR131_W25). You will need to login with your Drexel credentials to access the environment.\n",

But with great power comes great responsibilityâ€”and potential headaches. To keep things smooth and ensure everyone has the same gear, we're sticking with the cloud-hosted [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/). It's like having a roadie to handle all the tech stuff, so you can focus on your coding performance.  \n",
