    "### The Value of Using Getters and Setters\n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem like a lot of extra work, but using getters and setters provides several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: Getters and setters allow you to hide the internal representation of an attribute and expose it in a controlled manner. This helps in maintaining the integrity of the data by preventing unauthorized access and modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation**: Setters can include validation logic to ensure that any value assigned to an attribute meets certain criteria. This helps in maintaining the consistency and correctness of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: By using getters and setters, you can change the internal implementation of an attribute without affecting the external interface. This makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Computed Properties**: Getters can be used to compute the value of an attribute dynamically, based on other attributes. This allows for more complex and derived properties without storing redundant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Debugging**: Getters and setters can include logging or debugging statements to track when and how attributes are accessed or modified. This can be helpful in identifying issues and understanding the behavior of the code.\n"
