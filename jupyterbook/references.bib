	abstract = {© 2017 ACM. There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional classroom setting. This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the effciency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-Available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benets (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.},

	abstract = {© 2017 Holdgraf, Rieger, Micheli, Martin, Knight and Theunissen. Cognitive neuroscience has seen rapid growth in the size and complexity of data recorded from the human brain as well as in the computational tools available to analyze this data. This data explosion has resulted in an increased use of multivariate, model-based methods for asking neuroscience questions, allowing scientists to investigate multiple hypotheses with a single dataset, to use complex, time-varying stimuli, and to study the human brain under more naturalistic conditions. These tools come in the form of “Encoding” models, in which stimulus features are used to model brain activity, and “Decoding” models, in which neural features are used to generated a stimulus output. Here we review the current state of encoding and decoding models in cognitive electrophysiology and provide a practical guide toward conducting experiments and analyses in this emerging field. Our examples focus on using linear models in the study of human language and audition. We show how to calculate auditory receptive fields from natural sounds as well as how to decode neural recordings to predict speech. The paper aims to be a useful tutorial to these approaches, and a practical introduction to using machine learning and applied statistics to build models of neural activity. The data analytic approaches we discuss may also be applied to other sensory modalities, motor systems, and cognitive systems, and we cover some examples in these areas. In addition, a collection of Jupyter notebooks is publicly available as a complement to the material covered in this paper, providing code examples and tutorials for predictive modeling in python. The aimis to provide a practical understanding of predictivemodeling of human brain data and to propose best-practices in conducting these analyses.},

BDNNs are trained using a novel binarized back propagation algorithm (BBP), which uses binary weights and binary neurons during the forward and backward propagation, while retaining precision of the stored weights in which gradients are accumulated. At test phase, BDNNs are fully binarized and can be implemented in hardware with low circuit complexity. The proposed binarized networks can be implemented using binary convolutions and proxy matrix multiplications with only standard binary XNOR and population count (popcount) operations. BBP is expected to reduce energy consumption by at least two orders of magnitude when compared to the hardware implementation of existing training algorithms. We obtained near state-of-the-art results with BDNNs on the permutation-invariant MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets.",

  author   = {Obermeyer, Ziad and Powers, Brian and Vogeli, Christine and

  abstract = {Health systems rely on commercial prediction algorithms to
              identify and help patients with complex health needs. We show
              that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide
              approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant
              racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are
              considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of
              uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase
              the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from
              17.7 to 46.5\%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts
              health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care
              means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for
              White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an
              effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive
              accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice
              of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can
              be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts.},
